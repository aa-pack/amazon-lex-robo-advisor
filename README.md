### Functionality
I built a robo advisor that when prompted about retirement investment advice, collects basic demographic information such as the user's name, age, investment principal, and risk tolerance, and then provides a protfolio composition that is suited to their needs. The program is built on Amazon's Lex platform and also utilizes a custom AWS Lambda function to verify age and investment range, and correctly match the portfolio with the user's risk appetite.
